**************************************************************************
A simple version of Pong that requires two players, one using 'w' and 'a'
and the other using up and down. The goal is the same as regular Pong
where you don't want the ball to touch your edge, so you hit it back
with the paddle. First to 5 points wins, and you can keep repeating
until you exit. This game was made using the PyGame package and was
an introduction project.
